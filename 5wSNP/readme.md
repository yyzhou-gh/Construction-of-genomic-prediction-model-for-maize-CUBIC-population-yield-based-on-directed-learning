### 'dataset': 
Datasets of CUBIC population, including training set (394 lines with genome: 5w SNPs, transctiptome: 26743 gene expressions, phenome: 20 phenotypes) and testing set (1008 lines with genome: 5w SNPs, phenome: 20 phenotypes).<br>
### 'code.R':
The script of the parameters selection of G2GPG2Phe2EW (genome to GPGs to phenome to EW) and G2GPG2EW (genome to GPGs to EW), training and testing process of G2EW (genome to EW), E2EW (transctiptome to EW), Phe2EW (phenome to EW), G2GPG2EW, G2GPG2Phe2EW and G2GPG&Phe2EW (genome to GPGs + phenome to EW).
