### 'dataset': 
Datasets of CUBIC population, including training set (394 lines with genome (5w SNPs), transcriptome (26743 gene expressions), Sub-Trait (19 sub-traits) and EW) and testing set (1008 lines with genome (5w SNPs), Sub-Trait (19 sub-traits) and EW).<br>
### 'code.R':
The script of the parameters selection of G2GPG2Sub-Trait2EW (genome to GPGs to Sub-Trait to EW) and G2GPG2EW (genome to GPGs to EW), training and testing process of G2EW (genome to EW), E2EW (transctiptome to EW), Sub-Trait2EW (Sub-Trait to EW), G2GPG2EW, G2GPG2Sub-Trait2EW and G2GPG&Sub-Trait2EW (genome to GPGs + Sub-Trait to EW).
