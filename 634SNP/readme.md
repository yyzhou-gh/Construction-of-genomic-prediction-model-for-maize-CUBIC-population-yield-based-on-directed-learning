### 'dataset':
Datasets of CUBIC population, including training set (394 lines with genome (634 tag SNPs), transcriptome (26743 gene expressions) and Sub-Trait (19 sub-traits) and EW) and testing set (1008 lines with genome (634 tag SNPs), and EW)).

### 'code.R':
The script of the  training and testing process of G2EW (genome to EW).

### 'model':
The G2EW model constructed in training set. It can be used to predict EW with the 634 tag SNPs.
