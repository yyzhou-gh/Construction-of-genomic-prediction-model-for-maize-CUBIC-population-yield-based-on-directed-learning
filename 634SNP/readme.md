### 'dataset':
Datasets of CUBIC population, including training set (394 lines with genome: 634 tag SNPs, transctiptome: 26743 gene expressions, phenome: 20 phenotypes) and testing set 
(lines: 1008, genome: 634 tag SNPs, phenome: 20 phenotypes).

### 'code.R':
The script of the  training and testing process of G2EW (genome to EW).

### 'model':
The G2EW model constructed in training set. It can be used to predict EW once input the 634 tag SNPs.
