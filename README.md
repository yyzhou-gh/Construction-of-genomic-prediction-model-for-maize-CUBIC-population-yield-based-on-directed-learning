# Genomic prediction of maize eight weight by integrating transcriptomic and sub-traits information with a directed learning strategy
In this study, by observing not only the successful experience of the directed learning strategy for integrating genomic and transcriptomic information, but also non-negligible advances for reminding the importance of integrating sub-trait information, we build a novel directed learning architecture (DLA) to successively integrate genomic, transcriptomic and sub-traits information into a single model.  
We uploaded two projects at two density of SNPs: 5w SNPs (the optimal density) and 634 tag SNPs (selected by our model which are related to the EW prediction).
