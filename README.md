# Genomic prediction of maize eight weight by integrating transcriptomic and sub-traits information with a directed learning strategy
In this study, by observing not only the bottle neck of integrating genomic and transcriptomic information, but also a non-negligible advance of integrating other agronomic trait information, we built a novel MLLASSO architecture to successively integrate genomic, transcriptomic and phenotypic (sub-traits) information into a single model. We uploaded two projects at two density of SNPs: 5w SNPs (the optimal density) and 634 tag SNPs (selected by our model which are related to the EW prediction).
